## Agenda
* Vote Calvin into Releases WG! ðŸŽ‰
* Backporting Proposal (see Slack thread here for more context): https://electronhq.slack.com/archives/CC80G2R6H/p1616708870019400
  * TL;DR: Changes that could be backported - particularly docs changes - are sometimes missed. Do we want to add a new `no-backport` label to explicitly call out when backports are not needed, instead of assuming they arenâ€™t needed by default?
  * Outcome: 
    * Add a requirement of no backport or the specific backport
    * Add field to PR template to add label for outside contributors who cannot add labels - text field asking where they would like to backport
      * Maintainer/Merger would then add appropriate labels
    * Anton will add new code to trop (thanks Anton!)
* Releases Guide: https://github.com/electron/maintainers/pull/300 Any input welcome
* Next Releases WG Chair: Call out this week, vote in next meeting
